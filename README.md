Anomaly Detection and Recommendation Systems algorithms assignments for Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera.

Programming language: Matlab/Octave

Most people don't actually know how machine learning algorithms work or what is going on behind the scenes when 
they use machine learning libraries. I think it is important to have a fundemental understanding of the actual algorithms because 
it can help in the machine learning process; determining which algorithms may work best or for tweaking models.

I completed Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course a while ago which was about making machine learning models from scratch 
using mathematical methods: vectors and matrices.

This repository contains one of the assignments in the course which is making algorithms for Anomaly Detection and 
Recommendation Systems from scratch. The reason I am uploading it is because I would like to show the type of machine learning 
that I have knowledge in and have done on other machine learning projects.
