Anomaly Detection and Recommendation Systems algorithms assignments for Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera.

Programming language: Matlab/Octave


I completed Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course a while ago which was about making machine learning models from scratch 
using mathematical methods: vectors and matrices. The course did a great job at showing the important to have a fundemental understanding 
of the actual algorithms at work because it can help in the machine learning process; determining which algorithms may work best or for 
tweaking models. 

Most people don't actually know how machine learning algorithms work or what is going on behind the scenes when 
they use machine learning libraries. In an Artificial Neural Netowrk (ANN) example, one can write a line of code, with the Keras
library, to create another layer in their network with the expectation that more layers will make a better model without even 
knowing what that one line of code actually does. However, if the person knew the fundemantals behind ANN's of forward and back 
propogation they might have taken a different approach in improving their model because all they did was make their model 
more complicated and might end up having high-variance (over-fitting). If they had more knowledge and knew a little bit more
of the mathematics itself behind ANN's Maybe they would assess their current model  to be sufficiently complex and not needing 
another neural layer but instead more training examples to for the model to calibrate.

This repository contains one of the assignments in the course which is making algorithms for Anomaly Detection and 
Recommendation Systems from scratch. The reason I am uploading it is because I would like to show the type of machine learning 
that I have knowledge in and have done on other machine learning projects. 

* I have not uploaded my answers for the assignment so they can't be plagiarized.
